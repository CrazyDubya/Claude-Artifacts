run artifact_manager.py
do some NPM and NPX stuff
profitt

no seriously, this needs work because there was alot of trial and error. It doesnt automate most of the setup work, you will still need to use terminal and --force some component installs. 

really this is just a proof of the environment but think its useful so throwing it out there

If you can muddle through and get the envrionment going, should be no issue  running and loading n artifacts by copying the file from claude.ai and dropping it in app-analyzer/src/claude_artifacts as a jsx file.
