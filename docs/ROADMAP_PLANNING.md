# Claude Artifact Manager: Roadmap Planning

## Introduction

This document outlines a multi-phase strategic plan for prioritizing, researching,
deep-diving into, and implementing the potential upgrades identified in the
[`POTENTIAL_UPGRADES.md`](./POTENTIAL_UPGRADES.md) document.

The goal is to provide a structured and efficient approach to evolving the
`claude-artifact-manager` tool, ensuring that development efforts are focused,
impactful, and aligned with the project's long-term vision.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Prioritization Framework

Before diving into specific feature development, establishing a clear framework for
prioritization and effort estimation is crucial. This ensures a consistent and
objective approach to roadmap planning.

### Prioritization Criteria

The following criteria will be used to evaluate and prioritize features from the
`POTENTIAL_UPGRADES.md` document:

1.  **User Impact (High, Medium, Low):**
    *   How significantly will this feature benefit the end-users?
    *   Does it solve a major pain point or unlock critical new capabilities?
    *   High: Addresses a common, critical need or provides substantial value to most users.
    *   Medium: Provides noticeable improvement or value to a significant portion of users.
    *   Low: A niche improvement, nice-to-have, or benefits a small subset of users.

2.  **Development Effort (S, M, L, XL - see Effort Estimation Model):**
    *   How much time and resources will be required to design, implement, and test this feature?
    *   This will be an initial rough estimate, refined during a deep dive.

3.  **Strategic Importance (High, Medium, Low):**
    *   How well does this feature align with the overall goals and vision for the project?
    *   Does it enable future development or open up new strategic opportunities?
    *   High: Directly supports a core strategic goal or is a prerequisite for other key features.
    *   Medium: Complements strategic goals or provides moderate strategic advantage.
    *   Low: Less direct alignment with current strategic priorities.

4.  **Dependencies (Number/Complexity):**
    *   Does this feature depend on other features being implemented first?
    *   Are there external dependencies or prerequisites?
    *   High: Many complex dependencies or blocked by significant external factors.
    *   Medium: Some dependencies that need coordination.
    *   Low: Few or no dependencies, can be implemented relatively independently.

5.  **Community Demand / User Feedback (High, Medium, Low - if available):**
    *   Is this a feature frequently requested by users or the community?
    *   (Initially, this might be low for many items until broader feedback is gathered).
    *   High: Strong, clear demand from multiple users/sources.
    *   Medium: Some interest or indirect requests.
    *   Low: Not actively requested.

### Effort Estimation Model

A simple T-shirt sizing model will be used for initial high-level effort estimation:

*   **S (Small):**
    *   Estimated a few days to 1 week of focused effort.
    *   Well-understood, small scope, low complexity.
    *   Example: Minor CLI flag addition, simple documentation update.
*   **M (Medium):**
    *   Estimated 1-3 weeks of focused effort.
    *   Moderately complex, requires some design or investigation.
    *   Example: A new CLI command with straightforward logic, basic template enhancements.
*   **L (Large):**
    *   Estimated 3-6 weeks (or 1-2 months) of focused effort.
    *   Significant complexity, requires careful design, may impact multiple areas.
    *   Example: Implementing CI/CD, basic TypeScript support, a new major CLI command.
*   **XL (Extra Large):**
    *   Estimated 2+ months of focused effort.
    *   Very complex, high risk, major architectural changes, or extensive research needed.
    *   Example: A full plugin system, support for other meta-frameworks like Next.js.

These estimates are rough and will be refined during the "Deep Dive & Research" phase for prioritized features.
