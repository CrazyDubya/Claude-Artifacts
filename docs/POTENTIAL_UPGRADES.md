# Potential Upgrades for Claude Artifact Manager

This document outlines potential areas for future enhancements and new features
for the `claude-artifact-manager` tool. The goal is to make the tool more
powerful, flexible, and user-friendly.

## 1. CLI Enhancements

*   **Interactive Mode:**
    *   **Description:** An interactive mode for commands like `init` or `add` that guides the user through options with prompts.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves usability for new users, reduces the need to remember all CLI flags.
*   **Configuration File:**
    *   **Description:** Support for a project-specific configuration file (e.g., `.claude-amrc`) to store default options for CLI commands (like default project type, preferred dependencies).
    *   **Benefits:** Streamlines repetitive tasks, allows for project-level standards.
*   **Enhanced Output and Logging:**
    *   **Description:** More verbose logging options (e.g., `--verbose`), structured output (e.g., JSON output for scripting), and clearer progress indicators for long operations.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves debuggability and integration with other tools.
*   **`update` Command:**
    *   **Description:** A new command `claude-artifact-manager update --project <dir>` to update base project files (templates, Vite version, etc.) to the latest versions provided by the manager.
    *   **Benefits:** Helps projects stay current with improvements in the core scaffolding.
*   **Dry Run Mode:**
    *   **Description:** A `--dry-run` flag for commands like `add` or `scan` to show what changes would be made (dependencies installed, files created/modified) without actually making them.
    *   **Benefits:** Increases safety and allows users to preview changes.

## 2. Generated React App Features

*   **Advanced Scalability Templates:**
    *   **Description:** Offer alternative `App.jsx` templates or options during `init` to include basic pagination, infinite scrolling, or virtualization for the artifact list.
    *   **Benefits:** Directly addresses the challenge of handling thousands of artifacts, provides better performance out-of-the-box for larger projects.
*   **Theming and UI Customization:**
    *   **Description:** Easier ways to theme the scaffolded React app (e.g., integrating a theme provider, options for different color schemes or UI libraries during `init`).
    *   **Benefits:** Allows users to quickly align the look and feel with their brand.
*   **Built-in Search/Filter for Artifacts:**
    *   **Description:** Add a basic search and filter functionality to the default `App.jsx` template to allow users to easily find artifacts by name or other metadata.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves usability when dealing with many artifacts.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling for Artifact Loading:**
    *   **Description:** More robust error boundaries and user-friendly messages in `App.jsx` when an artifact component fails to load or renders with errors.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves the debugging experience for artifact creators.
*   **State Management Options:**
    *   **Description:** Option during `init` to include a basic setup for state management libraries like Zustand or Jotai.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides a starting point for more complex application state in the generated app.

## 3. Artifact Handling & Metadata

*   **Support for Different Artifact Types:**
    *   **Description:** Extend beyond React components. Could involve different handling or templates for plain HTML/JS artifacts, Vue components, or other web component types if Claude produces them.
    *   **Benefits:** Increases the versatility of the tool.
*   **Advanced Metadata Extraction:**
    *   **Description:** Standardize and extract more metadata from artifact files (e.g., author, version, description, tags) if available (e.g., from JSDoc comments or a manifest within the artifact itself). This metadata could be used in the `claude_artifacts_manifest.json`.
    *   **Benefits:** Enables richer display and filtering in the viewer app.
*   **Artifact Versioning:**
    *   **Description:** A system to manage multiple versions of the same artifact. This is complex and might involve naming conventions or directory structures.
    *   **Benefits:** Useful for tracking changes and allowing rollback or comparison.
*   **Automatic README/Docs Generation for Artifacts:**
    *   **Description:** If artifacts contain structured comments (JSDoc), the tool could generate simple Markdown documentation for each artifact.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves discoverability and understanding of artifacts.

## 4. Dependency Management

*   **Support for Yarn or PNPM:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to choose Yarn or PNPM instead of NPM for JavaScript dependency management during project initialization.
    *   **Benefits:** Caters to different user preferences and project requirements.
*   **Interactive Dependency Resolution:**
    *   **Description:** If conflicting versions of dependencies are detected (e.g., an artifact requires a version different from an already installed one), provide options or warnings.
    *   **Benefits:** Helps manage complex dependency trees more gracefully.
*   **Dependency Update Command:**
    *   **Description:** A command to help update dependencies within the managed JS project, perhaps by leveraging tools like `npm-check-updates`.
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies keeping project dependencies up-to-date.

## 5. Testing and CI/CD

*   **Automated Tests for the Python Package:**
    *   **Description:** Implement a comprehensive test suite (unit and integration tests) for the `claude-artifact-manager` Python code itself using `pytest`.
    *   **Benefits:** Ensures stability and reliability of the tool, facilitates safer refactoring.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**
    *   **Description:** Create a GitHub Actions (or similar) workflow for linting, testing, building, and potentially publishing the Python package.
    *   **Benefits:** Automates development workflows, ensures code quality.
*   **Test Scaffolding for Generated Projects:**
    *   **Description:** Option during `init` to include basic test setup (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library) in the generated React project.
    *   **Benefits:** Encourages testing of the artifact viewer application itself.

## 6. User Experience (UX)

*   **Improved Error Messages:**
    *   **Description:** More context-aware and actionable error messages throughout the CLI and in the generated application.
    *   **Benefits:** Reduces user frustration and speeds up troubleshooting.
*   **Configuration Validation:**
    *   **Description:** Validate any user-provided configuration (e.g., in a future `.claude-amrc` file) and provide clear feedback on errors.
    *   **Benefits:** Prevents runtime issues due to misconfiguration.
*   **Colorized CLI Output:**
    *   **Description:** Use colors in the CLI output to highlight important information, warnings, and errors.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves readability and visual appeal of the CLI.

## 7. Plugin System / Extensibility

*   **Plugin Architecture:**
    *   **Description:** Design a plugin system that allows users or other developers to extend the `claude-artifact-manager` with new commands, artifact types, or project templates.
    *   **Benefits:** Creates a more flexible and community-driven tool. Hooks could be provided at various stages (e.g., pre/post-init, pre/post-scan).

## 8. Advanced Scaffolding Options

*   **Support for Next.js or Other Meta-Frameworks:**
    *   **Description:** Allow `init` to scaffold projects using Next.js, Astro, or other popular React meta-frameworks instead of just Vite.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides more powerful starting points for users needing SSR, SSG, or other advanced features.
*   **Choice of UI Libraries:**
    *   **Description:** Option during `init` to select from a list of common UI component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design) instead of the default Tailwind CSS based components.
    *   **Benefits:** Caters to diverse design preferences and existing component ecosystems.
*   **TypeScript Support:**
    *   **Description:** Option during `init` to scaffold a TypeScript-based project (e.g., `.tsx` files, `tsconfig.json`).
    *   **Benefits:** Improves code quality and maintainability for larger projects.

This list is not exhaustive but provides a starting point for discussing the future
direction of the `claude-artifact-manager`.
